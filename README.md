# e-Canteen-System
The Institution is in need of an “e- CANTEEN SYSTEM” which could be used for the enhancement of better food supply in the canteens of the institution, which could address certain issues such as (1)Paper billing (2)Queue management (3)Cash management (4)Time management (5)Food wastage management. The system provides multiple levels of access to different set of users.
The main purpose of this project is to help every individual of PSG College of technology to pre book their food in the college canteens based on their tastes and preferences. It also allows organizers of the canteen to create publicity for the newly implemented food items or events. It is based on relational database which keeps track of the quantity of food ordered which helps the organizers to prepare food in less quantity for least liked food items and more quantity for most liked item in demand.
